After years of delays, I finally decided to update this mod for the newest teardown versions!
The entire UI and most functionality of the menu has been built from the ground up.

[h1]What is this?[/h1]
A collection of toggleable modifications and cheats to assist with gameplay or development.
There are cheats and utilities included. Some may be more useful then others, but I find the menu to be incredibly handy for my own use. I initially created it for myself years ago, but wanted to polish it up and make it available for others

[h3]To open the menu ingame, click return / enter![/h3]

[h1]What are the "Tool" mods?[/h1]
These mods are simple utilities that activate upon using a tool.

To set the tool you want to use, simply hold that tool in your hand, open the menu, and hit the "Tool" button next to the mod.

[h1]How do I set keybinds?[/h1]
Only a few mods require keys, but theyre easy to set.

Simply click the "Key" button next to the mod, youll see it change to "...", which means its awaiting a key to set.

Id recommend not using any teardown-defined or special keybinds. Return (enter) is the only keybind you cannot use, because it is used to open the menu ingame

[h1]Other Tips:[/h1]
For the increment / decrement buttons, you can click the white text in the middle to reset them to their defaults.

Holding shift while incrementing or decrementing a value will double the amount it changes.
Holding ctrl behaves similarly, but halves it instead of doubling it.

Clicking the "Extra Boost Keybinds" button in the config page will allow you to bind separate horizontal and vertical keybinds for boost mods! Added due to popular demand from the old versions.
